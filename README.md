TWITTER APPLICATION ðŸ’»
Welcome to our twitter app, to use our app you need:

1. Register users
2. Log in to your registered user
3. Create a post
4. Click on your username to access your profile. There you can see, among other things, bio, username, hometown, etc.

Clone this repository to your local machine. Install dependencies by running npm install in the project directory. Start the development server by running npm start.

In our assignment, a crucial component called "trending" is missing, which is a feature where users can search for profiles or trending hashtags. We hope to add this component later to bring the project together. Due to the absence of this component, we are unable to link the number of correct followers.
